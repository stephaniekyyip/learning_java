# Codecademy: Java

### Introduction to Java

- Print: `System.out.println("text");`

- Data types:

  - `int` : Values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647

  - `bool` : Either `true` or `false`

  - `char` : A single character, must be enclosed in single quotes, e.g. 'g'

- Variable: Store a value and must have a specified data type.

  - E.g. `int num = 7;`

- Whitespace is ignored in Java and is used to make code more presentable.

- Comments

  - Single line comment: `// comment`

  - Multi-line comment: 

    ```java
    /*
    	here's another comment
    	continuation of that comment
    */
    ```

- Math: `+, - , *, /`

  - Modulo `%` : Finds the remainder of a divison

- Relational operators: `<, <=, >, >=`

  - Used to compare data types have that defined ordering, like numbers.

  - Always returns a boolean (true/false)

- Equality operators: `==, !=`

  - Operands can be different data types

  ```java
  int num = 7;
  int bool = true;
  System.out.println(num == bool); // false
  ```
